/*int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
cout << *(a) << " " << *(a+1);
ans 
Index:   0   1   2   3
Value:   1   2   3   4
Address: 100 104 108 112 
a is the base address of the array (a points to a[0]).
*(a): This is equivalent to a[0], which is 1.
*(a+1):
a + 1 moves the pointer to the next element (a[1]).
*(a + 1) is the value at a[1], which is 2. (assuming int is 4 bytes)*/
